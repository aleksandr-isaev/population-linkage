1. The synthetic dataset is .m2 and is called:
	/Users/al/.m2/repository/uk/ac/standrews/cs/valipop-synthetic-populations
	
	
2. Changed application.properties to be:

repository_name = synthetic-scotland_13k_1_clean
store_path = /Users/al/Desktop/store


3. Run data into store using:

	package uk.ac.standrews.cs.population_linkage.data.synthetic;
	
			ImportSyntheticScotlandRecordsToStore
			
	with:
	
	    public static void addAllToStore(Path store_path) throws Exception {

	        String[] populationNames   = {"synthetic-scotland"};
	        String[] populationSizes   = {"13k"};    // TOM: ,"133k","530k"
	        String[] populationNumbers = {"1"};     // TOM: ,"2","3","4","5"
	        String[] corruptionNumbers = {"0","1","2"};
